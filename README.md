ft_printf for ecole 42

first methode was creating a function pointer array and mapping 1to1 to each flag which would be indexed in a int array. spent 3-4 days on it without any results.

new method is just yolo-ing it and doing a big chunky if-else-if statement, works perfectly fine and could make it pass most tests with only 7 hours in.
